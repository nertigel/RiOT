### RiOT.lua (version 1.4.9.6)
The forgotten successor of d0pamine.lua

RiOT was based off d0pamine_base.lua(LUX styled WarMenu from Mar 27, 2020). There's no reason to why I'm leaking it other then to let this community rot in peace.
This menu probably has more shit to offer over what current pastes in the market have to offer, I didn't want to self-leak it but I don't think it would do any damage to the community, nobody cares about it anymore anyways.

Enjoy it pasters!
